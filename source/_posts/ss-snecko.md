I attempted Ironclad A2 recently, but (unfortunately) got Snecko Eye as the starting relic. I'm not the giving-up type, instead I developed some strategies that I didn't believe it would work.

## Strategies

### Deleting *all* defences

The motivation is simple: Snecko Eye gives me 7 cards of *random* costs between 0-3, thus assuming all of them to be Attack cards implies that I can use *more* attacks in one turn.

This turned out true: having lots of attacks not only allowed me to kill an enemy instantly, thus preventing taking damage, but also yielded great result when fighting Gremlin Nob, whose strength increases by 2 whenever player uses a Skill.

With cost of Bash and Clothesline reduced to 0 or 1, I can also increase damage dealt and decrease damage taken effectively, allowing player to heal up in rest sites before being beaten to death.

### Taking *lots* of high-cost attack cards

As Snecko Eye treats all cards equally, it's intuitive that high-cost cards suits a Snecko round better.

In fact, in later rounds my attacks are so strong that I can rest less, without using *any* defence cards.

### Picking up Velvet Choker

As I have no card that allows extra drawing, Velvet Choker can normally allow playing another 1-cost card, which can evidently improving attacking performance.

## Oppotunities

### Having Gambling Chip as relic

Well, this is 100% RNG, but it greatly boosted my confidence.

At the start of a round, I just discard all 2-cost and 3-cost cards, hoping that the rest contains 0-cost and 1-cost cards. This stategy worked smoothly, averagely ensuring 5 attack cards (potentially 2-cost or 3-cost before Snecko) being played in a turn. This dramatically increased the amount of damage dealt per turn.

### Blocking 44 heart damage with Incense Burner

This is unexpected, too. Without Incense Burner giving Intangible, I can only beat the game with only 3 hearts left!

Blocked damage is calculated by:

$$
\begin{align*}
60 \times \frac{3}{4} - 1
\end{align*}
$$

The 3-quarter factor comes from Weak applied by Clothesline.
