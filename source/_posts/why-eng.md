Everything began with one of my friends commenting another blog, at 2023-09-08 17:33.

> 话说你这博客全eng好强啊

Translation: btw it's impressive that your blog is in full English

At that moment, I thought it would be interesting if I make a English blog too. It took me 5 days to finally set up my blog.

Sensibly speaking, Chinese blog and English blog both has its advantages and disadvantages. But for me, it's purely a spur-of-the-moment choice to write in English.

The following are some obscure advantages of writting in English. Please note that by listing the advantages, I don't think English is prior to Chinese. In fact, I'm also maintaining a [Chinese blog](https://blog.nowcoder.net/5eqn). 

## Smoother editing experience

Using [leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim) plugin, I'm capable of moving my cursor to *any* position within under 5 clicks, consuming less than 0.5 second, with only one prerequisite:

- The character at target location can be directly typed within keyboard

This means if I write Chinese blog with Neovim, my navigation capabilities will be greatly depressed, adding inconveniency when modifying past contents.

## More console-ish

Do you feel that way?

这是一段中文。

This is an English sentence.

The monospace font makes you feel like it's on a console, fitting the minimalist theme of the whole blog.
